Please check the problem definition and report pdf files under docs folder for details about the project.

NOTE 1:

Initial HP levels of both characters are 200
You can change HP values from the Blastoise.h and Pikachu.h files,
which are under /model/characters folder, if you want.

NOTE 2:

For the last part of the homework, maximum level of graph is selected as 9.
Because the easiest path is available at level 7 and level 8 with these 200 HPs.
However, if you want to increase the graph level, you can change it from the main.
Parameter is defined as PART3_MAX_LEVEL at the top of the main.cpp file.

NOTE 3:

You don't need to provide any file such as pikachu.txt or blastoise.txt to run the project.
They are under ../usecases/read_skillset_from_file/ folder and my reader class can
find it. If you want to change them with your own files, you can find them there to replace.
Please don't change the project folder structure. My code is designed with
CLEAN architecture and SOLID principles. It may increase the run time little bit,
but the project is more readable and maintainable with this design principles.
